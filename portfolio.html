                <h2>Inspiration & Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Artists often, in their work, neglect to take care of their body. Poor posture combined with overwork (among other factors) result in body pain and, when left alone as is for too long, result in possible irreparable damage that requires serious medical attention. When faced with these pains, drawing becomes painful or impossible. Especially for artists whose livelihoods depend on their output of art, physical self-care is crucial yet often overlooked. 


                    <br><br>
                    <strong>ArtRelief</strong> is a mobile app designed for artists to schedule breaks and guide them in stretches that <i>aim to help relieve body pain and encourage healthier habits</i>. ArtRelief lets artists select from a long list of stretches and exercises that each target a specific body part to add to a personalized routine. Once set, the artist can input a work period, in which a timer will run as the artist works until it reaches zero, at which point the tablet will notify the artist to perform their selected routine under the guidance of the appâ€™s tutorials.
